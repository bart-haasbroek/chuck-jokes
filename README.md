# ChuckJokes

This is a small app which fetch random jokes of chuck norris.
It is made as a introduction assignement for a job, and the following features where required:
- The possibility to fetch jokes after clicking a button
- When these jokes are fetched via a button they need to be displayed in a list. In this list we can mark
certain jokes as favourite. The favourite jokes will appear in a favourites list with a max of 10
(unique) items. There should be an option to remove jokes from the favourite list as well.
- On refresh the favourites lists should be maintained.
- the possibility to turn on/off a timer via a button who will add one random joke to the
favourites list until the list has 10 items.
